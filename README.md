# Introduction:

In this project, we will be finding out potential frauds or anomalies in a bank dataset on Credit Cards Applications. 
The goal is to unearth which clients could be potential fraudsters, which the bank could later go and investigate further.

## What are SOMs or Self-Organizing Maps in Deep Learning?
SOMs or Self-Organizing Maps are unsupervised DL algorithms that help in finding patterns within the dataset, much like how the K-Means clustering algorithm does in machine learning.
Here, we have used SOMs for identifying potential anomalies in the dataset.

### There will be no accuracy scores within this project. 

## IMPORTANT NOTE:

This dataset is relatively small, therefore with each re-run, the SOM would identify different anomalies. 
This is therefore, just for learning and working purposes. 
SOMs work best on big datasets, wherein the variations would be much lesser and the results consistent across several re-runs. 
This project is therefore just for learning and illustrative purposes on how SOMs work in general.


Many thanks, Rachana
